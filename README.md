This folder contains the final report and project code for Group 7 of Intelligent Interactive Systems.
-- DataPreprocessNew.py is the file to run on the data files and get the features that we want to use i.e. in this case it is the distances.
-- FinalProject.ipynb is the final python notebook with all the model parameters and their respective output along with the images.
-- FinalProject.py is just the code without any of the results.
-- finalVotingModel.pkl contains the final method that we developed and is serialized. It can used by how one opens a file in python.
-- finalScaler.pkl contains the scaler we used to scale the input features and must be used when predicting on new landmarks.
-- TestSampleCode_Pipeline.py is a sample code to run to check how our model reads input and outputs an emotions. Run this for Pipeline with a few changes as mentioned in the file.
-- CVsample.py This is a sample code we developed as a substitute for the pipeline and can be used to check our model too.
